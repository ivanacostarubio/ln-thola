# THOLA

Ever wonder how many nodes you can pay some satoshis? 

A tool to know how well connected your node is. 



## Example:

```shell

./lnd_thola -- %satoshis% %path_to_cert% %path_to_macaroon% %socket e.g. 127.0.0.1:100500%

./thola 100000 ./tls.cert ./readonly.macaroon 192.168.1.128:10009

```
